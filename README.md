# MRI_BrainTumor_Isolator
This project started off as a spinoff of an image processing module I wrote for a laser guided landing system for a drone. The system processes the MRI image of the brain to produce an output image consisting of regions of interest(Tumors). The research paper I wrote for this was accepted by the Internaional Journal of Pharma and Bio Sciences.
